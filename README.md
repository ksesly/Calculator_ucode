# Calculator
# Web calculator created with soul

## Welcome to project
> Project was created by @Sheeseburger and @ksesly
## Explaining the idea
We had two part of project
1. Basic
2. Creative

Its just normal calculator:
1. User can do math.
    - Add numbers.
    - Make any arithmetic logic that user wants
2. It is bulletproof.
    - Division by zero is imposible for user
    - All variables have basic value, so in error case user will see 0 or 1

### Basic
### Display:
We have two fields:

- "Previous" that shows what user already made
- "Current" that used in two cases:
>1 For displaying current number that user picking
>2 For displaying result, so it can be used for further usage. 

### keyboard
> **% **- finds 1 percent of number
> **CE** - cleans current number
> **C** - full clean
> **+/- ** is change number to it negative value
> **.** - add decimal point, if number is empty, adds 0

### Reusing equal symbol
> We implemented system, that all clickes further clicks on equal symbol will repeat last 
>operation

### Example of usage

### Advanced
>Here begins magic
>Display remains same, but keyboard is new

### Keyboard
> x^n - x will be raised to n
> sqrt - finds square root of number
>n! - factorial of number
> \>.< - is just a placeholder :D

### What unsual can be done?
>As it was mentioned before calculator was build with soul, so it can help even in strange situation
> For example, you badly need to know, what is factorial of one percent of square root of 900 000
